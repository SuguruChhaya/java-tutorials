
//*To code in Java, I MUST declare a class. The class name is the same as the file name.
//*In the Java programming language, each command is written on its own line. A semicolon must be placed at the end of a command.
//*First comes class, then methods, then commands
//*The class body is written in curly brackets.
//!The first method I make has to be a main() method. The main() method is ran by default
//*Side note: I have destroyed the following 
public class printing
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //*println prints things in a different line but print prints stuff in the same line
        System.out.println("Hi!! ");
        //!But println makes it so that the next print command is printed on a next line, even if it another println.
        //*Therefore, if I want to add something to a line, I should start with a "print", then a println
        System.out.println("My name is Suguru!! ");
        System.out.println("Nice to meet you!!");
    }
